# togglmine

This simple tool helps your daily inputs from [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to
Redmine time\_entry, searching for your working data stored in Toggl and
printing curl commands to store the data to Redmine.  You should review printed
commands and execute it.  You no longer have to input manually by Web browser.
